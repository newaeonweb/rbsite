<h1 >Apologize</h1>
<p style="font-size: 1.3em">We would like to apologize to everyone for the inconvenience generated by our old host, godaddy.com.<br>

We made a mistake in the renewal of our hosting, but our dear host Godaddy can not satisfactorily meet us and we had our website offline for nearly a week. <br>

Again we apologize on behalf of the lack of competence of Godaddy to remedy our problem.

In a few weeks we will have the website back.

To use our tool please visit: <a href="https://github.com/newaeonweb/responsiveboilerplate">Responsive Boilerplate on Github</a>

<p>Sincerely. <br> ResponsiveBoilerplate Team</p>
